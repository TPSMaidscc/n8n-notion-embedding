- Real-time editing with auto-save functionality
- No more static JSON files - everything is dynamic!

Quick Start
===========

## Method 1: URL Parameters (Recommended & New!)

You can now pass workflows directly via URL parameters! Perfect for Notion embedding:

**Option A: Direct workflow JSON**
```
https://your-site.com/n8n-editor/?workflow={"nodes":[...],"connections":{}}
```

**Option B: Load from external URL**
```
https://your-site.com/n8n-editor/?workflowUrl=https://github.com/user/repo/raw/main/workflow.json
```

**Option C: Load from n8n API**
```
https://your-site.com/n8n-editor/?workflowId=123&n8nUrl=https://your-n8n.com
```

## Method 2: Interactive Mode

1) Deploy to any static host (see hosting options below)

2) Open your deployed site and:
   - Enter your n8n instance URL (e.g., https://your-n8n-instance.com)
   - Click "Connect" 
   - Enter your API key when prompted
   - Select any workflow from the dropdown
   - Start editing directly in the interface!

## Method 2: Static Mode (Legacy)

1) Replace the preview JSON:
   - Export your workflow from n8n, remove any credentials
   - Overwrite workflow.json with your exported workflow

2) Update the edit link:
   - Open your workflow in n8n, copy the editor URL
   - Update the WORKFLOW_EDITOR_URL in index.html

Legacy Headers for Notion Embedding
===================================

If using older hosting platforms, create a _headers file:

/*
  Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://www.notion.so https://notion.so *
  X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://www.notion.so

Note: Most modern hosting platforms handle this automatically.
